VGA_sync_gen

	all provided code -> hmax in VGA_LIB package on his website

	every cycle we should update the horizontal counter

	some process()
		hcount++
		if (hcount = MAX_VALUE) --MAX_VALUE = ???
			hcount = 0;
		if (hcount = appropriate_count_val) 
			--increment vcount
		if (vcount = some_other_max_val)
			vcount = 0

	pseudocode for counting logic ^

	same entity, probably not in the same process (should PROBABLY make it combinational logic)

	go through and assign a counter value for every event in the waveform
		if we are between this_count and this_other_count, then HORIZ_SYNC should be 0
		VSYNC should be 0 except for a smalllll P region of time

	TEST THIS VERY THOROUGHLY BEFORE MOVING ON TO THE NEXT PART

the entire output for the vga interface is the RAM and the VGA_SYNC_GEN
	translate the hcount and the vcount into addresses on the RAM using some logic

each pixel in the actual image (in ram) gets mapped to a 2x2 block of pixels on the screen

divide hcount by 2 tog et the column address on the screen

make a 25 mHZ clock and divide the clock using the clock divider defined in a previous lab
	use that for EVERY component

the VGA_sync_gen is the most importnat entity
	no code given, but he has explicitly outlined how this should be done

define 2 counts, one for the horizontal sync and one for the vertical sync

the two column and row mapping entities are very very siumilar
	once you get one working, copy and paste it to the other entity
	first, check to see if there is a button pressed
		if you arent in the D region (check hcount !?) then output black
		draw in the appropriate corner
			top left corner -> linear mapping with no changes
			top right corner -> create a mapping fxn for the column addresses (nothing for rows, rows dont chage), its just subtracting off some offset



SOME CONSTANTS ARE NOT CORRECT AND STITT DID THIS PURPOSELY

RAM is one cycle behind the controller
	register the output of the VGA_SYNC_GEN to match it
	delay registers
	really big deal in industry and DD
		proabbly a question on the next midterm (;
